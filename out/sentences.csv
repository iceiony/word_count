118,"And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests."

147,"Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story."
148,"any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq."

160,"As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats."
161,"As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism."
162,"As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction."

166,"At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future."
167,"At this point I turned around and said \"Hey, where's Lugar?"
168,"Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive."
169,"Because I think that this is our moment to lead."
170,"Because I think we've all had enough."

189,"But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?"
190,"But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict."
191,"But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?"
192,"But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring."
193,"But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy."

205,"But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?"
206,"But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ? in a public and unambiguous way ?"
207,"But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush."
208,"But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible."
209,"But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time."

218,"But Washington has a long way to go."
219,"But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own."
220,"But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need."
221,"But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement."
222,"But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions."

230,"But, Kenya must do its part."
231,"But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union."
232,"By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference."

664,"That's the journey we're on today."

697,"The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity."

720,"The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success."
721,"The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?"
